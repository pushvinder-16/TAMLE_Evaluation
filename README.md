# House Price Prediction

This package is used to predict house prices based on several features like location, median income of the household, total rooms, and more. It leverages Python's scientific and machine learning libraries to process data, develop models, and make predictions.

# Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the package on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Scipy
- Six

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy six

# Installing and Running the Package

Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-price-prediction.git


Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd house-price-prediction
```

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

The main script fetches the dataset from an online source, performs data cleaning and preparation, and uses various machine learning models to predict house prices.

Here is an overview of the operations performed:

1. Fetching and loading data.
2. Splitting data into training and testing sets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4. Handling missing values and categorical features.
5. Implementing models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
6. Using Grid Search and Randomized Search for hyperparameter tuning.
7. Evaluating models and making predictions.

The results of these operations, such as model performance metrics, are printed out to the console. You can modify the script according to your requirements to get more insights or to tweak the model's configuration.
